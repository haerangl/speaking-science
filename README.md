## Abstract
It seems today's 24 hour news cycle is filled with headlines highlighting the effects and consequences of our changing climate. Yet, political apathy to respond continues to be an issue. We ask, does the geographic focus of scientific articles have an impact on how much people buy into them?

## Research 
### Question 
Does engagement with scientifically oriented article increase as they become more locally relevant? 

### High Level Execution
This experiment will be executed via an online survey on Qualtrics. It will be conducted as follows: 

#### Treatment
Survey respondent is randomly assigned to treatment or control. If in control, the respondent will be asked to read an article with national implications. If in a treatment group, the respondent will be asked to read an article with either state-wide or county-wide implications. 

#### Procedure 
* Respondent will be asked: 
    * to read the assigned article 
    * open ended reading comprehension questions about the article 
    * to gauge how credible the article was
    * to gauge how urgent the article was
    * to provide demographic information (age, education, political leaning)

#### Example topics
| Control | Treatment (State) | Treatment (County) |

#### Blocking
We intend to block on age, education, and political leaning.

#### Clustering
We do not forsee a clustered experiment at this time.
