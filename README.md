## Abstract
It seems today's 24 hour news cycle is filled with headlines highlighting the effects and consequences of our changing climate. Yet, political apathy to respond continues to be an issue. We ask, does the geographic focus of scientific articles have an impact on how much people buy into them?

## Experiment Design
### Research Question 
Does engagement with scientifically oriented article increase as they become more locally relevant? 

### High Level Execution
This experiment will be executed via an online survey on Qualtrics or Mechanical Turk + Qualtrics. Details are discussed below. 

#### Experiment Bounds
We plan on running this experiment on adults (ages 18+) in select metropolitan areas.

#### Treatment
Survey respondent is randomly assigned to treatment or control. If in control, the respondent will be asked to read an article with national implications. If in a treatment group, the respondent will be asked to read an article with either implications restricted to their metropolitan area (e.g. Los Angeles, New York). 

#### Outcomes
Ultimately, we're interested in measuring user engagement, urgency, and buy-in with our article. 

#### Survey Flow:
* Intro instructions and consent agreement 
* Subject reads the article 
    * Control group read the non-local or national article
    * Treatment group reads the local article
    * Record total time users spent reading the article  
* At the bottom of the article there is a “Click Next” button. Once clicked, the users cannot go back.
* Ask 5 multiple choice questions regarding the article. % of correct answers will be a measure of reading comprehension
* Ask people to donate:
    * “1 out of 200 people will win $100 (yes, we’re really going to give out cash). If you win, how many dollars of the $100 would you like us to pay to the Name of Society, supporting air pollution reduction efforts for local/non-local name? You will receive $100 minus whatever you instruct us to pay”.
* Ask them to rate the credibility of the article on a scale
    * 5-Likert scale (i.e. 1 for “strongly disagree”, 2 for “disagree”, 3 for “neutral”, 4 for “agree”, and 5 for “strongly agree”).
* Sample questions from social media research
    * AC3: The authors who share information online are credible because my friends recommended them
    * AC6: I need to check the background of the author before I can accept what I read/view in the article.
    * KQ3: It is important to me that the knowledge shared on social media is usable and reliable.
    * KQ5: I only trust online information if there is quality and knowledge in the message shared.
    * CD2: Authentic media content will not close down or be discontinued.
    * CD8: Social media content should have continuous responses from public to prove that it is reliable.
    * AI6: Nobody can assess the quality of media content even with a lot of recommendations from public/experts.
    * AI8: True credible authors may be demotivated from continuing their knowledge sharing online.
* Ask them how urgently we should be acting to address the issue at hand on a scale from 1 - 10, 1 being not an issue and 10 indicating action is needed right now.
* Ask demographic questions:
    * Age:  
        * Broad ranges
    * Level of education: 
        * Some high school
        * High school graduate
        * Some graduate school
        * Masters
        * Professional Degree
        * PhD
    * Political leaning: 
        * Left, left/center, center, center/right, right

#### Covariants
We intend to include age, education, and political leaning as covariates.

#### Clustering
We do not forsee a clustered experiment at this time.
