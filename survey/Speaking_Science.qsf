Some also fear that the shipping industry and the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach will use their clout to weaken the proposed restrictions, which the Air Resources Board will decide on in the first half of the year.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\"We need relief; it's just that simple,\" said Theral Golden of the West Long Beach Assn., a neighborhood group that has long fought for cleaner air in a community that is among the hardest hit by port pollution.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">At stake in the battle are billions of dollars in potential costs at the nation's busiest seaport, which handles roughly 40% of U.S. imports and remains overwhelmingly powered by diesel-spewing trucks, ships, locomotives and cargo-handling equipment. The volume of shipments moving through the two ports has more than tripled since the mid-1990s, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">But the growth in shipping activity also comes at the cost of people's health across Southern California, especially near the ports. Despite dramatic emissions cuts by the ports in recent years, neighboring communities such as Wilmington, San Pedro and West Long Beach still have the region's highest cancer risk from air pollution and higher rates of asthma compared with the rest of the state.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\"Right now we have larger ships carrying more cargo, and they're bringing more pollutants,\" Golden added. \"We understand that cargo has to move and goods have got to be moved. But it should not be at the expense of our health, and at the expense of our children.\"<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It was more than a decade ago when the L.A.-Long Beach ports pioneered a major effort to clean up their operations by phasing out their dirtiest sources of diesel pollution. State regulations over the last six years have forced increasing numbers of container ships, refrigerated cargo ships and cruise ships docked at the largest ports to plug in or to connect to emissions controls. But the rules do not apply to more than half of the 8,000 ocean vessels visiting California each year, according to figures provided by the Air Resources Board.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The Air Resources Board proposes to extend such restrictions to additional ports, ship calls and and vessel types, including tankers and roll-on\/roll-off ships, which carry cars, trucks and other vehicles. The rules would increase the number of ship visits subject to the rules from about 43% today to about 71% by 2029, air board figures show.<\/span><\/p><br><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Largest polluters in L.A.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Some of the vessels at issue are so large they are like floating warehouses or small cities. If not plugged in while docked, they must keep their engines and boilers running. In one 24-hour period in port, a single cruise ship can burn enough fuel oil to equal the pollution from 10,000 cars, according to air quality officials.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">But plugging in such hulking, power-hungry vessels isn't simple.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">On a recent weekday, diesel exhaust billowed skyward from the stacks of the Yang Ming Movement, a fully loaded container ship that rumbled into the Port of Los Angeles after its journey from Shanghai.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It took half a dozen workers and two hours to connect the 960-foot-long ship to the electrical grid. Crew members slowly lowered electric cables as thick as fire hoses down the side of the vessel to longshoremen who attached the red and blue plugs, weighing 30 pounds each, into receptacles on the dock.

But in recent years, progress in fighting air pollution at the L.A.-Long Beach ports has waned, with some emissions creeping upward.

Some also fear that the shipping industry and the ports of New York and New Jersey will use their clout to weaken the proposed restrictions, which the Air Resources Board will decide on in the first half of the year.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\"We need relief; it's just that simple,\" said Theral Golden of the Brooklyn Heights Assn., a neighborhood group that has long fought for cleaner air in a community that is among the hardest hit by port pollution.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">At stake in the battle are billions of dollars in potential costs at one of the nation's busiest seaport, which handles roughly 18% of U.S. imports and remains overwhelmingly powered by diesel-spewing trucks, ships, locomotives and cargo-handling equipment. The volume of shipments moving through the two ports has more than tripled since the mid-1990s, supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">But the growth in shipping activity also comes at the cost of people's health across Northeast, especially near the ports.

State regulations over the last six years have forced increasing numbers of container ships, refrigerated cargo ships and cruise ships docked at the largest ports to plug in or to connect to emissions controls. But the rules do not apply to more than half of the 8,000 ocean vessels visiting Northeast ports each year, according to figures provided by the Air Resources Board.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The Air Resources Board proposes to extend such restrictions to additional ports, ship calls and and vessel types, including tankers and roll-on\/roll-off ships, which carry cars, trucks and other vehicles.

By 2031, the rules are expected to slash emissions of diesel particulate matter and nitrogen oxides from docked ships by about half and reduce their contribution to cancer risk around the ports of New York and New Jersey by 55% over the same period.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Community groups say they shouldn't have to wait that long for those health benefits and want regulators to adopt a more aggressive timeline.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\"Ships are massive polluters, and they have the most room to improve,\" said Peter Warren of the Carroll&nbsp; Gardens Homeowners Coalition. \"They are also the right target to achieve the greatest gains because their movements are tracked and they can't hide, and there are solutions to make them cleaner.\"<\/span><\/p><br><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Who pays?<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Environmentalists and community groups in some of the hardest-hit neighborhoods argue the public has long paid for port-related emissions with their health. But the shipping industry has fought against tougher rules, which they argue would be too costly for the amount of pollution reduced.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\"We don't think we need a brand-new rule,\" Mike Jacob, a vice president for the Atlantic Merchant Shipping Assn., which represents ocean carriers and marine terminal operators, told state regulators at a hearing in New York last month. \"We think we need to be making small administrative tweaks to a successful rule and make it even better.\"<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Outfitting one ship with the equipment to plug into shore power costs $1 million or more, according to industry representatives. They argue this price tag isn't cost effective for ships that rarely make stops in New York; they say they'll need more shore-based emissions capture systems to comply.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The New York and New Jersey ports, which have spent hundreds of millions of dollars building outlets and other electrical infrastructure since they introduced shore power in the mid-2000s, have echoed industry concerns.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Heather Tomley, managing director of planning and environmental affairs for the Port of New York, said the port supported moving forward with additional emissions controls. \"But we also need to be realistic about the timeline that it will take for these technologies to develop and be proven, and for the infrastructure to be installed,\" she said.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The state estimates it would cost industry $2.16 billion over the next decade to comply with the new rules, resulting in health benefits valued at $2.25 billion, including the avoidance of hundreds of early deaths from air pollution. Air Resources Board staff plan to bring the final regulations to the 16-member panel for a final hearing in the spring.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Diane Takvorian, an Air Resources Board member who directs the Environmental Health Coalition based in the Newport area, says further reductions from ships in port are critical because they are among the biggest pollution sources affecting the state's most disadvantaged communities.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\"This is a historic step and a big step,\" she said.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 700; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Enforcement wanted<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In harbor-area communities, neighborhood groups that want tougher pollution restrictions remain skeptical that new rules will be backed up with tougher enforcement, pointing to a history of noncompliance with ship plug-in requirements at the Port of New York.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In 2015, the New York Times revealed that the port had privately rolled back pollution-cutting measures at the Red Hook Shipping terminal, giving the company permission to violate shore power requirements starting in 2009. In 2016 the port released an audit showing it also failed to meet pollution-reduction requirements at the Howland Hook Marine terminal, including mandates that ships plug into shore-based electricity.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Last month, the Air Resources Board announced Rotterdam-based shipping giant P&amp;O Nedlloyd Container Lines had paid $965,000 in penalties after a state audit of its fleet's visits to the ports of New York and New Jersey discovered 2,600 violations of the shore power rules from 2014 to 2017.<\/span><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\"This is a resistant industry and it needs policing and auditing,\" said Warren of the Brooklyn Heights Homeowners Coalition. \"If you're going to make the rules stricter, you need to make the enforcement stronger too.\"<\/span><\/p><div><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; color: rgb(29, 28, 29); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br><\/span><\/div><\/span>","DefaultChoices":false,"QuestionType":"DB","Selector":"TB","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false},"Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"Source: NY Times Port ships are becoming NY\u2019s biggest polluters.
